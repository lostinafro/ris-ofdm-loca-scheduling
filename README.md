Code implementing the algorithm and the benchmark of the paper "Localization-based OFDM framework for RIS-aided systems"

## Abstract
> Efficient integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) into the current wireless network standard is not a trivial task due to the overhead generated by performing channel estimation (CE) and phase-shift optimization. In this paper, we propose a framework enabling the coexistence between orthogonal-frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and RIS technologies. Instead of wasting communication symbols for the CE and optimization, the proposed framework exploits the localization information obtainable by RIS-aided communications to provide a robust allocation strategy for user multiplexing. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with respect to CE-based transmission methods.

The paper is submitted to the Holographic MIMO workshop of ICC 2023.

The main results of the paper are obtainable by running
```
test_robust_max_min.py
test_robust_max_rate.py
```
to obtain the max-min and max-rate scheduler allocation
Note that the scripts should be run with the flag ```-r``` to save the results. 

The standard parameters can be edited changing ```environment.py```. 

Visualization of the already presented results can be obtained running ```visual_robust_performance.py```. 
Also in this case flag ```-r``` print the results, in both .jpg and .tex format, in a ```plots``` directory.
Check and edit ```scenario.common.standard_output_dir``` to change the default saving folder
